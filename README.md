# Description
The project here before you has been one of my most challenging projects yet. It humbled me a lot, and taught me even more. I am very proud of this project and what it represents in my growth as a student, and progression as a programmer. I called this project CodePost because it has a nice ring to it. The idea is very simple, a social media like site where developers post code snippets, a lot like github, and very inspired by github. The project is meant to display a few things, database usage and management, request handling, and the communication between the two. I chose the format I did, that being code snippets, because I am very passionate about programming, and it seemed like fun. The most challenging aspects of this project would have to be the storing the code in the database, and correctly implementing the function of each request handler. It was amazing and I learned so much, I enjoyed working on this a lot, and I hope that it inspires you as much as it did me.
